        <p>During my Ph.D. years at Clemson university, I worked with a team on working Periop MLS app
        for Greenville Health Systems. Periop MLS is a smart mobile application designed to be used
        by surgeons, nurses, CRNAs, and anesthesiologists on the day of surgery. A focal point of
        this project is to embrace and enhance mobile technology to facilitate patient flow through
        Periop (Pre-op, OR, and PACU) by improving coordination between units and advancing post-hoc analysis.
        You can learn more about this cool app from this <a href="https://youtu.be/nkG10d9xZv4">video </a>.

          <p>While I was working on my Master’s degree at Northern Illinois University,
          I got the chance to do an <em>“engineer in residence”</em> program at Caterpillar Inc.
          where I developed a discrete event simulation model to study storage utilization.
